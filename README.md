# AnimeJS
This is my first project on AnimeJS. This is an obvious duplicate of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMhHEVznWEY&amp;t=196s of this youtube video tutorial. 
I'll be making a lot more AnimeJS projects because I found it very interesting while working on this project. You can go and watch the tutorial by clicking on the above link, I'm very thankful that I came across this video and decided to try it out.
For future projects I will be doing my own coding, this project is used by me to learn some concepts of AnimeJS before diving deep into learning it.
